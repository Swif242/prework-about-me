      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>First and foremost I'm a husband and father, I have an amazing wife and two
         <br>wonderful kids. I'm a professional truck driver currently with the hopes
         <br>of becoming a software developer. Complacency has kept me behind the wheel
             of a big truck for too long and now it's time to do something i really 
             enjoy.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Tucson Az</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are auto mechanics, carpentry, 
        <br>and pretty much fixing stuff or building things with my hands.
        <br>My newest hobby is learning code and taking what ive learned 
        <br>from mechanics and my intrest in puzzles to creat somthing cool
        <br>and diagnose problems when they come up and figure out how to fix them. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would consist of something i love to do with the flexibility
         <br>to spend more time with my family and make more memories. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Tucson Az</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always had an intrest in tech and gadgets growing up and I've always wanted
             to know how thigs worked since you dont really ever get to see the moving
             parts (or code) behind the scenes. When i was younger me and my freinds 
         <br>would try to figure out how to hack the old school PSP (playstation portable).
         <br>I like the idea of being able to take what looks like random gibberish to the
         <br>to the average person and make to do something cool, and be able to say
         <br><em>"yup i did that".</em>
